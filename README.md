The STEMFIE-X kit is an extension of the [STEMFIE](https://www.stemfie.org/) project, it uses its basic principles with modifications for use as a platform for creating more complex structures and models using mechanical and electronic elements - motors, servos, electronic circuits and control by microcontrollers. The building kit is primarily intended for polytechnic teaching at secondary schools and the first semesters of universities in the teaching of parametric modeling, CAD systems, constructions of machines and mechanisms.
