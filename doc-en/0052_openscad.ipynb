    "**openSCAD** is an open-source environment for the construction and creation of 3D parametric models. Parametric models are not created in a graphical environment as in standard CAD programs, but using a simple programming language similar to C. With the correct program design, it is possible to change the properties of the designed structure without the need to rewrite the program. The home page of the program is [https://openscad.org](https://openscad.org/). The program allows the generation of *stl* files for 3D printing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the construction kit STEMFIE-X is a library for openSCAD, which extends the standard features of the program by parametric creation of components of the kit and the construction of models composed of them. There are many similar programs that allow parametric modeling (OpenJSCAD, DeclaraCAD, FreeCAD, CadQuery ...), we chose the openSCAD environment because of the simple syntax of functional programming, even if it does not provide such rich options as other programs. For working with STEMFIE-X blocks, the options of openSCAD are more than sufficient.\n",

    "Own creation of models in the openSCAD program requires elementary knowledge of working with a computer at the high school level. From a pedagogical point of view, however, the creation of models and their physical realization by 3D printing is a multidisciplinary task that generally develops\n",

    "* spatial imagination, knowledge of geometry, working with objects and their representation\n",

    "* mechatronics - connecting more complicated mechanical systems with electronics, sensors, control\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of freely available tutorials, videos and guides for openSCAD itself. For the construction of simpler constructions in STEMFIE-X, only elementary knowledge is sufficient, the vast majority of more complicated activities are implemented in libraries.\n"
