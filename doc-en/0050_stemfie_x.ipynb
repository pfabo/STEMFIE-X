Other graphic programs and design CAD systems such as FreeCAD, Blender, and Tinkercad can also be used to design and construct models.\n"

    "\n",
    "Areas of use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an intermediate level in teaching between constructions from construction sites and independent construction in professional CAD systems, with direct physical output of 3D printing of self-constructed devices and systems, primarily intended for the age category of high school students\n",
    "- robotics, robotic parts and components, arms, manipulators, robotic chassis\n",
    "- models of machines and equipment\n",
    "- models and teaching aids for subjects focusing on the construction of machine parts\n",
    "- teaching and demonstration aids for physics, electronics, sets of experiments, sets for demonstrations of electric motors, kits for sample electric circuits\n",
    "- functional mechatronic and electromechanical units â€“ for example plotter, irrigation system, CNC milling machine\n",

    "* the basic length unit BU (Base Unit) was adjusted to **10mm** (originally 12.5mm in STEMFIE). This size allows the simultaneous use of metal elements from the construction companies Merkur, Meccano (and related) and simplifies sketches, for which it is possible to use ordinary square paper with a grid of 5 mm\n",
    "\n",
    "* the diameter of the mounting holes was adjusted to 4mm (originally 5mm). This modification allows the use of standard M4 metal and plastic screws (or M3.5 from Merkur) to connect parts, as well as shafts and rods of this diameter for the construction of moving parts\n",
    "\n",
    "* the original library for OpenSCAD contained in one [file](https://github.com/Cantareus/Stemfie_OpenSCAD/blob/main/docs/stemfie.scad.md) was divided into separate parts according to the component type (beams, braces, holes , transformations, common ...). Some parts of the original library have been modified, unlike the original, the surfaces of all components are flat and without recesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* for creating gears, the [OpenSCAD Library for Gear Racks, Involute and Worm Gears](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1604369) by Joerg Janssen was included in the project without modification\n",
